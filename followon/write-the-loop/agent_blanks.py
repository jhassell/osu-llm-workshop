A tool is an ordinary Python function that takes strings and returns a string,
with a docstring. The adapter below turns its name, parameters and docstring
into the description the model sees. The model never runs anything: it asks
for a tool by name with arguments, this program runs the function, and the
result goes back to the model as a message from the tool. The loop stops when
the model answers in words or when the turn limit is reached.
