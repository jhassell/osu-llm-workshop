"""Module 5: an agent on your question. Two tools, a real research question.

    python 05_agent/starter.py                       the synthesis question
    python 05_agent/starter.py "your question"       the one from your pre-work
    python 05_agent/starter.py --planted             the planted-document check
    python 05_agent/starter.py --saved "question"    search the saved table, not yours

The two built-in questions are about the sample corpus, so they always search
the saved table, corpus/records.jsonl. Your own question searches your Module 3
table, 03_table/records.jsonl, unless you add --saved. Your table is never
changed either way.

The trace is saved to 05_agent/trace.json. Read it with
    python 05_agent/show_trace.py
and look for the line where the agent chose a tool: was it the right one?
