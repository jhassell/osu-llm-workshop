"""Module 5's two tools: search the table, read one document. Supplied.

    python 05_agent/tools.py             test read_document alone on doc_001
    python 05_agent/tools.py doc_009     test it on another id

read_document returns the text of one document. That is where the planted
document matters: whatever a document says is evidence for the model to weigh,
never an instruction for it to follow. The program, not the document, decides
what tools exist and what they are allowed to do. Both tools only read, which
limits what the agent can change. They do not stop it repeating whatever it
can read, so read_document is also limited in what it can open: only a .txt
file directly inside corpus/ or mine/, named by its doc_id.
