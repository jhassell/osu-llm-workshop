"""Your own documents: drop them in mine/, run this, and they are ready.

    python convert.py

Drag PDF, Word (.docx), Markdown or text files from your laptop onto the
mine/ folder in the file tree (or right-click mine/ and choose Upload). This
script writes a .txt next to each one and prints one line per file: how many
pages it had and how much text came out. A PDF that yields almost no text is
a scanned image; the line says so, and the sample corpus is always enough.

mine/ is listed in .gitignore, so nothing in it is ever committed or pushed.
