"""Module 6, the default path: a summarizer over a small CSV. Two marked edits.

    python 06_project/csv_tool.py        tests the tool on its own, no model involved

The sample file is an instrument log: one row per reading, with a condition
column and a value column. Change the two marked lines so the tool reports on
your columns and answers your question, run this file to test it, then add it
to the agent in starter.py with one line.
