#!/usr/bin/env bash
# publish-site.sh: put the site/ folder on a permanent public website (GitHub Pages).
#
# You run this yourself. OpenClaw is told never to run it: publishing is your
# decision. While your Codespace runs, site/ is already live on port 8000, and
# that address stops working when the Codespace stops. This gives the site an
# address that stays: https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/
#
#   bash publish-site.sh             check, confirm, publish
#   bash publish-site.sh --yes       skip the confirmation
#   bash publish-site.sh --dry-run   check and show what would be published; change nothing
#   bash publish-site.sh --help      this text
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. runs python3 .devcontainer/site-check.py and stops if site/ is not ready
#   2. shows how many files and how much data will go public, and asks you
#   3. reads your repository's owner and name from its git remote (origin)
#   4. asks GitHub whether the repository is public: GitHub Pages on a free
#      account needs a public repository
#   5. replaces the gh-pages branch of your repository with one new commit that
#      holds only the files in site/ (plus an empty .nojekyll, so GitHub serves
#      files and folders whose names start with _). Files and folders whose
#      names start with a dot are left out, as they are on port 8000. It is
#      built in a temporary folder: your files, your branch and anything you
#      have staged are not touched. It pushes with this Codespace's own git
#      sign-in.
#   6. turns on GitHub Pages from the gh-pages branch if it is not on yet. If
#      GitHub does not let this Codespace do that, it prints the settings page
#      and the two choices to make there; then run bash publish-site.sh again.
#
# To update the site, change site/ and run bash publish-site.sh again: the same
# address gets the new version. Each run replaces the gh-pages branch, so do
# not keep anything else on that branch.
#
# No token is read, printed or put on a command line by this script: git and gh
# use the sign-in this Codespace already has.
