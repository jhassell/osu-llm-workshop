# Serves ONLY the site/ folder on port 8000 and makes port 8000 public, so the
# site OpenClaw builds is live at https://<codespace>-8000.app.github.dev/ with
# no clicks. The server is site-server.py, which refuses any request whose real
# path is outside site/: the repository, .env and mine/ (your documents), and
# ~/.openclaw (the key, again) stay unreachable even through a symlink in site/.
#
# If your GitHub organization does not allow public ports, the port stays
# private: the site then opens only for you, from the Ports tab.
#
# Idempotent, prints nothing, never fails: everything goes to
# ~/.osu-llm-workshop-site.log. Outside a Codespace it does nothing.
