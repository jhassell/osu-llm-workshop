"""Find papers, check their DOIs, and write BibTeX. Standard library only.

    python 03_lit/lit.py "cover crops soil organic carbon"
    python 03_lit/lit.py "cover crops soil organic carbon" --n 5 --sort cited
    python 03_lit/lit.py --topics          the queries that work offline
    python 03_lit/lit.py "..." --offline    use only the saved answers in 03_lit/cache/

The command writes results/refs.bib and results/lit-search.json (results/ is
at the labs/ root and is never committed) and prints one line per paper:
title, year, DOI, verification state and retraction line.

Four functions do the work, and an agent can call them as tools:

    search(query, n=3, sort="relevance")   OpenAlex: candidate papers for a query
    lookup(doi)                            OpenAlex: the record for a DOI you already have (free)
    verify(doi, title=None, authors=None)  Crossref: does the DOI match, is it retracted
    bibtex(records)                        BibTeX text built from the metadata, no model

What the answers mean, and what they do not:
- search() returns candidates for a recorded query, in a recorded order, on a
  recorded date. It is not "the best papers on the topic".
- verify() says one of four things: verified, mismatched, missing, unavailable.
  "verified" means the DOI exists in Crossref and its title and first author
  match what you passed. It does not mean the paper supports any claim.
- The retraction line says "no retraction found in Crossref as of <date>" when
  Crossref lists none. That is a statement about Crossref on that date, not a
  guarantee about the paper.

Every live answer is saved in 03_lit/cache/. When a service cannot be reached,
the saved answer is used and the output says so, with the date it was saved.
No API key is needed. OpenAlex gives keyless users a small daily budget
shared by everyone on the same network address; if you have a free OpenAlex
key, put OPENALEX_API_KEY=... in .env and it is sent in a header.
