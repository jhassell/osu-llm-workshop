"""Smoke test for lit.py: the cases that go wrong on the day, checked before the day.

    python 03_lit/smoke_test.py            offline (cache only), then live if the network is up
    python 03_lit/smoke_test.py --offline  offline only

Offline mode replaces urllib's urlopen with one that always raises, so every
answer has to come from 03_lit/cache/. Live mode talks to OpenAlex and Crossref
and costs two OpenAlex searches ($0.002 of the daily budget). Prints PASS or FAIL
for each case and exits with 1 if any case fails.

The cases: three shipped papers verify; a DOI that does not exist; a known
retracted paper (Wakefield et al. 1998, The Lancet); a paper with no abstract;
a title mismatch and an author mismatch; a DataCite DOI; service failures
(network down with and without a saved answer, a timeout that is not
retried on every call, a 503 that is retried twice);
and BibTeX escaping and keys.
