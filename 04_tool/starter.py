"""Module 4: giving the model a tool. The same question, without and with it.

    python 04_tool/starter.py                        the demo question
    python 04_tool/starter.py "your question here"   the one from your pre-work
    python 04_tool/starter.py --no-tool "question"   without the tool, for comparison
    python 04_tool/starter.py --saved                search the saved table, not yours

Both runs get the same instructions (SYSTEM below); only the tool differs.
The program prints the exchange as it happens: what the model asked for, what
Python ran, what came back, and the answer. The trace is saved to
04_tool/trace.json. Read it against 04_tool/trace.md, the annotated one.
