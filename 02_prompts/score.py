"""The scorer for Module 2. Supplied; read it, do not edit it.

A reply counts as right when the expected label is the first label word that
appears in it. A reply that names two labels is scored by the first one it
names, so a hedge passes or fails by whichever label happens to come first. A
reply with no label word scores as "no label". There is no target score: the
point is the habit of changing one thing, scoring, and opening a miss to see
whose fault it was: the model's, the label's, or the prompt's, when it never
said which words to answer with. Two of the sixteen labeled documents are
genuinely arguable, one in the ten and one in the held-out six; the corpus
README says which.
